# Writing Samples
Thanks for stopping by to review some of my professional writing samples. These are topics I was responsible for researching, documenting, and ultimately incorporating into our Documentation team's help system. 


## Administrator Help Topic
This help topic titled "MHB Care Team Integration" describes configuration settings to enable chat functionality between a physician and a patient's care team. These configuration settings enable communication between a chat module built into the PatientKeeper browser and a third-party app on another mobile device.  

I've included this topic because I feel it is a good example of a complicated configuration that has been simplified and can make sense to even a novice administrator. The topic provides context and references to other pages where additional information exists. I worked very closely with the Product Manager on this topic to ensure it was accurate and easy for end users to understand. 

*Note that I've only included the files needed to view this topic so links to other topics in the help system do not work.*
