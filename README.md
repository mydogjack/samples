# Writing Samples
Thanks for stopping by to review some of my professional writing samples. These are topics I was responsible for researching, documenting, and ultimately incorporating into our Documentation team's help system. 

## End User Help Topic
This topic titled "Communicating with a Patient's Care Team in PK Messaging" describes chat functionality available within the PatientKeeper app that allows a physician to communicate with a patient's care team. 

I've included this topic because it's a complex feature that applies to only specific types of users in a specific scenario, so it was a challenging topic to create. This functionality also depends on system configurations, which are referenced from within this topic. I worked very closely with the Product Manager and software engineer to ensure the content was accurate, and I feel like this is a good example of concise end user content. 

*Note that I've only included the files needed to view this topic so links to other topics in the help system do not work.*

## Administrator Help Topic
This help topic titled "MHB Care Team Integration" describes configuration settings to enable chat functionality between a physician and a patient's care team. These configuration settings enable communication between a chat module built into the PatientKeeper browser and a third-party app on another mobile device.  

I've included this topic because I feel it is a good example of a complicated configuration that has been simplified and can make sense to even a novice administrator. The topic provides context and references to other pages where additional information exists. I worked very closely with the Product Manager on this topic to ensure it was accurate and easy for end users to understand.
